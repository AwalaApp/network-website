# Make your software work with and without the Internet

With [half the world population disconnected from the Internet](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx) and [much of the other half subject to severe censorship](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/), **the Internet can hardly be taken for granted**. Make your apps compatible with Relaynet, and they'll continue to send and receive data even if the Internet is unavailable.

Relaynet apps use the Internet seamlessly when it's available, but they can switch to a backup medium when the Internet is unavailable. The only backup medium at the moment are [couriers]({% link couriers.md %}) who relay data between the region disconnected from the Internet and a location with access to the Internet, but we plan to support additional backup media in the future.

Whether you're an individual, a charity or a company, we're here to help you try and eventually integrate Relaynet. Select one of the following options to learn more, and don't hesitate to post any questions/feedback on [our forum](https://community.relaynet.network/) -- We'd even love it if you stopped by to say hi!
