# Write an Awala app

Relaycorp offers high-level, open source libraries to make it easy to write desktop, mobile, CLI and server-side apps that communicate via Awala. We currently support Node.js, JVM and Android applications.

Check out [codelabs.awala.network](https://codelabs.awala.network) to get started! So far we've documented how to build [Android apps](https://codelabs.awala.network/codelabs/android-centralised/) that communicate with a [Node.js backend](https://codelabs.awala.network/codelabs/nodejs-pong/), but more codelabs are coming soon.
