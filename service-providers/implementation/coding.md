# Write a Awala app

Relaycorp offers high-level, open source libraries to make it easy to write desktop, mobile, CLI and server-side apps that communicate with Awala. You'll basically have to pick the appropriate library for your platform, and use it whenever you need to send or receive data.

We currently support Android, JVM and Node.js applications. Check out [codelabs.relaynet.network](https://codelabs.relaynet.network) to get started! And don't hesitate to stop by [the forum](https://community.relaynet.network/) if you have any questions.
