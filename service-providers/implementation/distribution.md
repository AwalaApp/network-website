# Distribute Awala apps

You can distribute Awala apps through traditional channels, such as the Microsoft Store or the Google Play Store. However, you may want to offer additional channels for those users who need to install and start using your app without access to the Internet.

## Android apps

In addition to publishing the app on the Google Play Store, we recommend that you use the offline methods below:

- [Use app signing by Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9842756?hl=en) and distribute the _universal APK_ signed by Google, which can be downloaded from the _app bundle explorer_ on the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/). Unfortunately, [this method isn't as smooth as it should be](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/180927886).
- Publish the app on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/), which supports [offline installs](https://f-droid.org/en/tutorials/swap/).

You might also be able to distribute your APKs using satellite services like [Knapsack for Hope](https://knapsackforhope.org/) or sneakernets like [El Paquete Semanal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paquete_Semanal).
