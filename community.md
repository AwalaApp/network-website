# Connect with the Awala community

We're very keen to help you get started with Awala and hear your feedback on the following channels:

- For general discussions, including issues when using Awala, go to [r/Awala on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Awala/).
- If you are User Experience (UX) designer, go to [r/AwalaUX on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AwalaUX/) to discuss UX-related topics.
- For technical discussions about building Awala services or Awala itself, go to [@AwalaNetwork on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/AwalaNetwork/discussions).

On the other hand, if you've discovered a security vulnerability, refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/relaycorp/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md) instead.

Finally, if you're an organisation interested in a partnership or consulting services, [contact Relaycorp directly](https://relaycorp.tech).
