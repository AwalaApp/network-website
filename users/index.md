# Stay connected with or without the Internet

As amazing and ubiquitous as the Internet is, we can't count on it when we need it most -- it just wasn't built to withstand repressive regimes, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or wars. By contrast, Awala was expressly conceived for those scenarios.

When you're connected to the Internet, Awala-compatible apps like [Letro](https://letro.app/en/) will simply use it, and you won't notice a difference.
When you're disconnected from the Internet, [couriers]({% link couriers.md %}) can securely transport your apps' data to and from the Internet -- without ever handing over your device to anyone.

You don't need to know or trust couriers at all! It's impossible for couriers -- or anyone who intercepts them -- to see or change your apps' data. They can't even see which apps you're using or link that data to you. The worst damage that a courier can cause is to drop your data along the way, and even then Awala will seamlessly detect it and correct it.

Watch the following video to get a better idea of how Awala works with and without the Internet.

You can also [read the overview of how Awala works]({% link users/overview.md %}) if you want to learn more.

Awala will be the network on which humankind can truly rely,
and providing resilient communication is just the beginning. Other short-term benefits include powering a new generation of apps that will be 100% free of spam and phishing, while offering better privacy and security. In the future, Awala apps will circumvent online censorship without you having to install Tor or VPNs separately.
