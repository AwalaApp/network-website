# Download Awala

**Awala itself is just a platform to run other apps**,
so you still need other apps like [Letro](https://letro.app/en/) to make the most of it.

By downloading, distributing or using Awala, you agree to abide by [our terms of service]({% link legal/terms.md %}).

## We work hard not to let you down

We're committed to the principles of freedom of speech, personal privacy, transparency and net neutrality. When you use Awala, you can be certain that there's nothing dodgy going on behind the scenes: there's no _phoning home_ or pesky ads, and everything is end-to-end encrypted.

The best thing is that you don't have to take our word for it:

- All the software components that make up the network are open source. If you can't find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aawala+org%3Arelaycorp), it doesn't exist.
- The process to package and distribute the software is fully automated, and also open source.
- Our commitments are actually codified in our [Terms of use and Privacy Policy]({% link legal/terms.md %}).
