# Stay connected with or without the Internet

As amazing and ubiquitous as the Internet is, we can't count on it when we need it most -- it just wasn't built to withstand repressive regimes, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or wars. By contrast, Relaynet was expressly conceived for those scenarios.

When you're connected to the Internet, Relaynet-compatible apps will simply use it and you won't notice a difference. But when you're disconnected from the Internet, you can get [couriers](./couriers) to securely transport your apps' data to and from the Internet -- without ever handing over your device to anyone.

You don't need to know or trust couriers at all! It's impossible for couriers -- or anyone who intercepts them -- to see or change your apps' data. They can't even see which apps you're using or link that data to you. The worst damage that a courier can cause is to drop your data along the way, and even then Relaynet will seamlessly detect it and correct it.

Watch this video to get a better idea of how Relaynet will work with and without the Internet:

Relaynet will be the network on which humankind can truly rely and providing resilient communication is just the beginning. Other short-term benefits include powering a new generation of apps that will be 100% free of spam and phishing, while offering better privacy and security. In the future, Relaynet apps will circumvent online censorship without you having to use Tor or VPNs.

We aim to start testing the first Relaynet app by Q4 2020, so stay tuned!

## Help us help you
