# Make your software work with and without the Internet

With [a third of the world population disconnected from the Internet](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx) and [much of the rest subject to severe censorship](https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/), **the Internet can hardly be taken for granted**. Make your apps compatible with Awala, and they'll continue to send and receive data even if the Internet is unavailable.

Awala apps use the Internet when it's available, but they can switch to a backup medium when the Internet is unavailable. The only backup medium at the moment are [couriers]({% link couriers.md %}) who relay data between the region disconnected from the Internet and a location with access to the Internet, but we plan to support additional backup media in the future.

If you're looking for inspiration, you could build apps to help people do the following:

- Send and receive emails.
- Post and get updates from social networks like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AwalaNetwork/status/1089211336171679745) or [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/10267).
- Get answers to queries like "coronavirus symptoms" using [DuckDuckGo Instant Answers](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/instant-answers-and-other-features/).
- Send and receive money -- including cryptocurrencies.

Whether you're an individual or an organisation, we're here to support you in your journey. We've created a website dedicated to software vendors:
