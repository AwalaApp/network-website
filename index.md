# Abstract

Computer networks around the world and beyond are susceptible to loss of connectivity that may last anywhere from a few milliseconds to a number of days. In some cases, there may be no connection at all between two nodes that require communication due to a lack of network infrastructure.

Establishing communication in such circumstances is the concern of the _Disruption-Tolerant Networking_ (DTN) field, also known as _Delay-Tolerant Networking_, which for decades has been led by space agencies, the military, and the academia.

The purpose of this project is to complement the DTN ecosystem with a new protocol suite, _Relaynet_, to extend DTN to consumer and enterprise software such as web, desktop and mobile applications.
