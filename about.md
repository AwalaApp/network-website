# About Relaynet

Relaynet will be the computer network on which humankind can truly rely, and the first order of business is to establish or restore connectivity in regions where the Internet is unavailable due to natural or human causes.

Cheap satellite-based services like [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) will fortunately solve this problem to a large extent, but they won't always be viable options. While cheaper, Starlink still won't be affordable enough at [$80/month and $100-$300 to set up](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/spacex-starlink-price-launch-date-how-to-see-elon-musks-constellation), or discreet enough to use at scale under a repressive regime. 

Relaynet will evidently be significantly slower than satellite-based services, but it will be instantly available to anyone in the world when they need it. That includes survivors in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, and people living under a repressive regime that cut off the Internet.

Relaynet was designed by [Gus Narea](https://gustavo.engineer/) at the University of Oxford with the initial goal of circumventing censorship by repressive governments, and he later founded [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech/) to support and scale the Relaynet project while keeping it as open and inclusive as possible.

The [security of the design has been independently assessed](https://relaynet.network/archives/security-audit-2019-03.pdf) and Relaycorp are currently building the foundation of the technology thanks to a contract with the [Open Technology Fund](https://opentech.fund/).

We expect Relaynet to be functional on Android by February 2021 and desktop by April 2021, and we plan to commission independent security and UX assessments afterwards. The implementations can be found under the [@relaycorp organization on GitHub](https://github.com/relaycorp).

## How to contribute

As soon as the foundation of Relaynet is available, our top priorities will be: to help [service providers](./service-providers) integrate or prototype the integration of Relaynet, and to start running small-scale pilots with [couriers](./couriers). Please [contact us](https://relaycorp.tech/) if you're interested in helping with either priority!

We're always keen to get feedback on the privacy and security of Relaynet, so if you're an expert in cryptography and/or networking, we'd very much welcome your feedback on [the specs](https://specs.relaynet.network/) and the apps we've built so far ([Relaynet Pong](https://github.com/relaycorp/relaynet-pong), the [public gateway](https://github.com/relaycorp/relaynet-internet-gateway) and the [Android Courier](https://github.com/relaycorp/relaynet-courier-android)). Please feel free to open an issue or create a PR in the corresponding GitHub project!

Other than the above, a great way to help is to follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/relaynet)/[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/relaynet_) and spread the word about Relaynet! Once the applications we're writing stabilize by Q1 2021, we'll also be welcoming code contributions and translations, so please bear with us.

Finally, prospective contributors are highly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the [Zen of Relaynet](https://specs.relaynet.network/RS-020) as it describes the guiding principles behind all the major decisions we've made.
