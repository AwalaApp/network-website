# About Relaynet

Relaynet was designed by [Gus Narea](https://gustavo.engineer/) at the University of Oxford and its development is now led by [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech/), which was founded to support and scale the project whilst keeping it as open and inclusive as possible.

As of December 2019, the implementation of Relaynet is being funded by the [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/). The goal of this project is to build the foundation to support Relaynet on desktop and Android by Q3 2020. The implementations can be found under the [@relaycorp organization on GitHub](https://github.com/relaycorp).
