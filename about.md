# About Awala

The long-term goal of Awala (formerly known as _Relaynet_) is to complement the Internet by providing all human beings with uncensored and timely communication anywhere in the universe -- without impairing the [fundamental rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of other human beings. The first order of business is to establish connectivity in regions where the Internet is unavailable due to natural or human causes.

Awala was designed by [Gus Narea](https://gustavo.engineer/) at the University of Oxford with the initial goal of circumventing censorship by repressive governments, and he later founded [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech/) to support and scale the project while keeping it as open and inclusive as possible.

The [security of the protocol suite was independently assessed](https://relaynet.network/archives/security-audit-2019-03.pdf) and Relaycorp started to build the foundation of the technology thanks to a contract with the [Open Technology Fund](https://opentech.fund/) in late 2019. Our current focus is on helping Android developers integrate Awala in their apps.
