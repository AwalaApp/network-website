# About Awala

The long-term goal of Awala (formerly known as _Relaynet_) is to complement the Internet by providing all human beings with uncensored and timely communication anywhere in the universe -- without impairing the [fundamental rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of other human beings. The first order of business is to establish connectivity in regions where the Internet is unavailable due to natural or human causes.

"Awala" means "sibling" in Wayuu (a native South American language), and it symbolises our goal to _empower_ -- not _digitally colonise_ -- all humankind.

## Current status

The project is being incubated by [Relaycorp](https://relaycorp.tech) -- a mission-driven, open source company founded by the author of Awala, [Gus Narea](https://gustavo.engineer) -- for the sole purpose of supporting the network.

Awala has been fully operational on Android, Linux, macOS and Windows since 2021, 
and we completed the implementation of the first compatible app ([Letro](https://letro.app/en/)) at the end of 2023.

## Independent assessments

The [Open Technology Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) has commissioned the following independent assessments:

- [Security audit of the protocol suite (2019)](/archives/security-audit-2019-03.pdf). All issues were addressed before starting the implementation of the protocol suite.
- [User Experience (2021)](/archives/ux-assessment-2021.pdf). [The issues raised are tracked on GitHub](https://github.com/relaycorp/relayverse/issues/32).

As of April 2024, we're requesting a security audit of the reference implementations.
We expect the report to be available by the end of Q3 2024.
